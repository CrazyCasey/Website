                also prefer 'grey' over 'gray'. I enjoy cold days in doors with a glass of whiskey and good literature.
                Warm days indoors with rum and a good book. I like art, photography and newer glitching. Stage plays,
                operas, punk concerts, and tattoos. And if I know they got pocket aces and they value bet me in, any
                hand is good.</p>

                    <h4>Shawn Casey</h4>
                    <p>Howdy y'all! My name is Shawn Casey. I am a Computer Science major. This is one of the last few
                classes required for graduation for me so I'm excited to be finishing up. I'm looking forward to having
                a more hands on experience on how the things we've learned thus far are applied in real world working
                environments. I am not currently employed and haven't been for 3 years, but am ready to start working
                again. Out of high school I worked for a high end cabinetry company doing all their design work on CAD.
                When the economy crashed so did my field. I've also done a good bit of masonry work and started a stone
                masonry company. My most recent job was doing graphic arts and web upkeep for a Carhartt distributor. I
                am from the Raleigh area but have lived in Al Ain (an hour south of Dubai) since August 2012. My wife is
                a teacher out here and I'm a stay-at-home father and student (hence not working for almost 3 years).
                Looking forward to this class!</p>

                    <p>My name is Pat Ferate and I am a distance learning student from Washington State. I've been working
                as a System Engineer for Northrop Grumman for 4 years. Before that I was a System Administrator and
                Developer for a small private company for 7 years. I have experience in a wide range of technologies,
                but I love working with Linux and Python.</p>

                <p>I have 3 daughters (1, 4, and 6) to keep me plenty busy. I love listening to independent hip-hop
                    music. I also contribute to a few open source projects and have some personal software projects that
                    I've been working off and on for a while.</p>

                    <p>My name is Matthew Payne. I'm a Computer Science major in my senior year of study. I'm taking this
                course as a part of my required curriculum and hope it helps me in my future endeavors as a software
                engineer in knowing how to present a product I want to pitch to someone. I'm currently working part time
                as a knife salesman. I enjoy playing video games, watching shows, and reading comics. I'm a pretty
                stereotypical nerd to say the least. Either way I hope this is a good semester, and I hope to do well in
                this class.</p>

                insight into the planning phases of a new project.
                I am currently employed as a junior software engineer with Outsite Networks in Norfolk, VA. I work with
                C#, T-SQL, and related technologies for our customer loyalty services. I previously worked at
                InMotionHosting as an expert support technician, I provided front line support for our unix based
                services primarily related to website hosting.</p>

                    <p>My name is William Strong and I’m a CS undergraduate student. I’m taking this class to meet the
                requirements for my degree. I’m currently employed at HRSD as a programmer analyst. I mostly work on
                systems integration, but do some application development from time to time. Before HRSD I worked as a
                programmer at Amerigroup (which was bought out by Well Point) doing application and report development.
                In my spare time (for which I have little of) I like to spend with my wife and kids and attempting to
                play the guitar.</p>
